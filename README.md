# Pygame_game
I wanted to make a little game with python. I quickly realized that everytime I want to add or change something I have to destroy my whole code first
and until I fixed everything I can't run the game.

This is just a boring astroid spaceship kind of game, but I try to add more and more to the game and focus on learning new stuff.
